            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Iriſh</hi> finding that they had not gain'd much Reputation by their Actions in the Field, or by being valiant and ſucceſsful in the taking of Towns, were reſolved at laſt to try what they could do in keeping of Towns committed to their Care and Courage: <hi>Carrick fergus</hi> was the place where they thought ſit, in ſome meaſure, to retrieve their Credit and Reputation: But when our Frigats at Sea, and Land Forces at Land had appeared before it, and made ſuch Breaches in the Walls, and Deſtruction in the Town, by their Guns and Bombs, they judged in ſafeſt for them to Capitulate and Surrender; which they did on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> laſt. The Garriſon conſiſted of near Two thouſand Men, and though at the firſt Summons ſent them by the Duke of <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> they were ſo ſtout as to refuſe to hearken to any Conditions of Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet their Courage not continuing long, they accepted of the Terms of Marching out with Colours flying Arms, and Drums beating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to go to <hi>Charlemont.</hi> But ſuch was the ill nature of the Rabble, that they fell upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101696:2"/> them in their March, and diſarm'd them. The Town has been ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly defaced by the continual playing of the Bombs for Five Days together, that it looks like a diſmal heap of ruine. Sir <hi>Henry Ingolsby</hi> is made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Town and Caſtle: A great deal of Arms, Ammunition, and Proviſions of all ſorts, was found in the Town. This has cleared the <hi>North,</hi> for the moſt part, of any conſiderable Party of the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> many come in dayly to the General. The Ships come laſt Night to <hi>High-lake,</hi> aſſure us of the Arrival of the Four Regiments of Horſe into the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Carrick-fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus;</hi> who were turning in into the <hi>Lake</hi> on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> as the Ships that are arrived here were turning out from thence.</p>
               <p>Neither is it in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> only, where Succeſs does ſo conſtantly attend their Majeſties Affairs, but even the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> afford us variety of Examples of Zeal for his Majeſties Service: For the Bloſſom of <hi>London</hi> coming from <hi>Antego,</hi> in <hi>June</hi> laſt, and arrived here two days ago, brings the News, that Sr. <hi>Nathaniel Johnſton</hi> not finding it ſafe for him to continue longer upon thoſe Iſlands, whereof he had the Government committed to him in the late Reign, is gone to <hi>Carolina,</hi> and that the Inhabitants of <hi>Mevis</hi> and other Iſlands had conſtituted Major General <hi>Codrington</hi> Governour in his room; That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Planters and Inhabitants of <hi>Montſerat</hi> had declared for the late King, and appeared in a Body of Seven or Eight hundred Men for that Intereſt, but that Colonel <hi>Blakeſton,</hi> the Governour of the ſaid Iſland had raiſed what <hi>Engliſh</hi> men he could, to the number of Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, with which he was reſolved to attack them: But the <hi>Iriſh</hi> no ſooner ſaw him appear with that unequal number of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, but they all offered to lay down their Arms, and upon Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles promiſed to diſperſe; at which inſtant of time a Reinforcement of an Hundred and fifty Men arrived from <hi>Antego</hi> and ſeized the chief of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> brought them up Priſoners to <hi>Antego,</hi> and ſolemnly Proclaim'd King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> with all poſſible Demonſtrations of Joy and Gladneſs. The new Governour <hi>Codrington</hi> hath ſent an Hundred Men from <hi>Mevis</hi> to St. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>'s to ſtrengthen the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt in that Iſland.</p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Hewets,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Villers</hi> Regiments of Horſe are to embark with the firſt fair Wind for <hi>Ireland</hi> to joyn the Duke of <hi>Schomberg.</hi>
